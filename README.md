# Multi-Label-Clinical-Text-Eligibility-Classification-and-Summarization-System
This project focuses on developing a system that automates the classification and summarization of clinical text eligibility using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs).
# Key Features:
Multi-Label Classification: Implemented Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for classifying clinical text based on eligibility criteria.
NLP Techniques for Feature Extraction: Utilized Word2Vec for word embeddings, entity recognition, count vectorizers, and TF-IDF to extract meaningful features from clinical texts.
Summarization: Explored various summarization techniques, including TextRank, Luhn summarization, and GPT-3, to generate concise summaries of eligibility requirements.
Evaluation: System performance was evaluated using ROUGE scores to assess the effectiveness of generated summaries.
This system provides a robust solution for processing complex clinical texts, offering both automated classification of eligibility and clear, concise summaries to assist healthcare professionals and researchers.
